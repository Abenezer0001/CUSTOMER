# InSeat Menu API Integration

## Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the changes made to integrate real API endpoints for fetching menu data instead of using static JSON files.

### Files Changed

1. **src/hooks/useMenuItems.ts**
   - Replaced JSON file loading with API call using `getMenuItems` from menuService
   - Added parameters for `restaurantId`, `categoryId`, and `subcategoryId`
   - Added data transformation to map API response to expected MenuItem interface
   - Updated dependency array to re-fetch when filter parameters change

2. **src/services/api.ts**
   - Removed JSON file imports
   - Replaced static data with API calls using functions from menuService
   - Added transformation functions to map API data to application interfaces
   - Maintained the same function signatures to avoid breaking changes
   - Removed artificial delays since we're using real API calls now
   - Added error handling for API calls

3. **src/pages/MenuItemDetail.tsx**
   - Removed JSON fallback mechanism
   - Simplified API fetching logic to use only the API service
   - Removed the fallback warning banner
   - Added better error handling

### New Data Flow

The application now follows this data flow for menu data:

1. **API Layer** (`src/api/menuService.ts`)
   - Contains the core API functions that communicate directly with the backend
   - Handles HTTP requests using axios
   - Provides typed interfaces for API responses
   - Functions: `getCategories`, `getSubcategories`, `getMenuItems`

2. **Service Layer** (`src/services/api.ts`)
   - Acts as a facade over the API layer
   - Transforms API responses to match application interfaces
   - Provides consistent error handling
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

3. **Hook Layer** (`src/hooks/useMenuItems.ts`)
   - Custom React hook that consumes the service layer
   - Manages loading and error states
   - Provides reactive data based on filter parameters

4. **Component Layer** (various components)
   - Consumes hooks and services to display data
   - No longer directly imports JSON files

### Benefits of the New Implementation

1. **Real-time Data**: The application now displays real data from the backend
2. **Filtering**: Menu items can be filtered by category and subcategory on the server side
3. **Consistency**: API responses ensure data structure consistency
4. **Maintainability**: Separation of concerns between API calls and UI components
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling throughout the application

## Potential Improvements

1. **Caching**: Implement React Query's caching capabilities more extensively to minimize API calls
2. **Pagination**: Add support for paginated API responses for large menu datasets
3. **Search Endpoint**: Create a dedicated API endpoint for searching instead of client-side filtering
4. **Featured/Popular Items**: Add backend support for featured and popular flags instead of simulating them client-side
5. **API Versioning**: Implement API versioning to handle future changes to endpoints
6. **State Management**: Consider using a central state management solution for shared data
7. **Environment Configuration**: Make the restaurant ID configurable through environment variables
8. **Error Boundaries**: Add React Error Boundaries to gracefully handle component-level errors
9. **Optimistic Updates**: Implement optimistic updates for adding to cart, favorites, etc.
10. **Offline Support**: Add offline capabilities by caching API responses

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test the transformation functions in `api.ts`
   - Test the `useMenuItems` hook with various parameter combinations
   - Mock API responses to test error handling

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test the data flow from API to UI
   - Verify that components render correctly with real API data
   - Test filtering and search functionality

3. **API Mock Tests**:
   - Create mock API responses for testing
   - Test with various error scenarios
   - Test with empty, partial, and complete data

4. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Test the complete user flow from browsing categories to ordering
   - Test with real backend or a staging environment
   - Verify loading states and error messages

5. **Performance Tests**:
   - Measure API response times and component rendering
   - Test with large datasets to ensure performance
   - Verify that filtering is efficient

## Implementation Notes

- A default restaurant ID (`rest1`) is used throughout the application. In a production environment, this should be configurable or determined based on the user's context.
- The API transformation functions handle differences between API response formats and the application's expected formats.
- Some features like 'featured' and 'popular' items are currently simulated client-side since the API doesn't support these flags yet.
- API error handling returns empty arrays or undefined values with console error logging to avoid breaking the UI.
